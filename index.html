          About Me
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I've been writing software for quite a while (almost 12 years, yikes!) and I <b>love</b> the process of taking an idea and making it a reality through technology. I believe quality software has the ability to change the world and how we interact with it and I'm always looking for ways I can use my skills in software engineering to improve things.</p>
          <p>Writing software is great, but writing <b>quality</b> software gives me the warm fuzzies. I'm a huge proponent of test-driven development, so much so that in 2017 I founded a company specializing in teaching and certifying organizations on the benefits of test-driven development. You can check out our website <a href="https://www.thoroughtest.com/">here</a>. We're really excited about transforming test-driven development into something that all developers can (and want to) do!</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>In addition to my formal work experience (which you can read about below if you're <b>really</b> bored) I've written a couple of npm modules that are freely available (one is under MIT and one is under GPL) to download, read, make fun of, and use.  I'm pretty proud of both of them even though I know there's a lot of room for improvement.  If you see something that could be better feel free to open an issue on Github.  I don't get as much time to work on these as I'd like, but I do try to maintain them as much as possible.</p>

          <p>As I mentioned in the About Me section up top, I'm a cofounder of ThoroughTest. If you're interested (like, at all) in test-driven development you can check out the guide I wrote for developers to get started <a href="https://www.thoroughtest.com/the-guide">here</a>. It is specifically geared toward developers and we do our best to explain the hows and whys of test-driven development.</p>
          <p>I manage three websites for some friends and family and I designed and developed all of them. Of course, the business owners gave me lots of input, but I've been the sole developer on all three of these sites. Like anything, I'm proud of some pieces and less proud of others, but it's all part of what I've done and what I can do.</p>
          <ul class="experience">
            <li><a href="http://massagebyelaine.com/">Massage by Elaine</a> is a friend of mine who is a fantastic massage therapist. What you can see if you click that link is how we brought her old site up to modern web standards and made it mobile-friendly in the process. Overall, we're both pretty happy with how it turned out, even if there are some pieces (like that darn scroll bar on smaller screens) that don't look quite right.</li>
            <li><a href="http://stillwoodstudios.com/">Stillwood Studios</a> is a fine woodworking company owned by a very close friend of mine. What we have up right now is due for an overhaul, but it gave him a presence and way for people to contact him for quotes. That was the goal when we started and neither of us have really had time to do more to it since it went up a few years ago</li>
            <li><a href="http://higherstandardshomeinspections.com/">Higher Standards Home Inspections</a> is my uncle's home inspection business near Atlanta, GA. This is probably the site I'm most proud of right now because we went from absolutely nothing (not even a logo) to what we have up now in about 5 months. We still work on it all the time and we're looking into adding a bunch of new features so I'm excited about what's to come.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>OK, fine, here's my formal experience (this is starting to feel like a resume)</p>
          <ul class="experience">
            <li>I started my career working for a small order fulfillment company where I got to work on cutting edge technology like dbase (in 2005). While I was there I built a full inventory management system using *drumroll* Microsoft Access! It was pretty impressive, but looking back on it is a bit embarrassing. On the other hand, it was a huge step-up from dbase and Visual FoxPro so I guess that's something.</li>
            <li>From there I moved to the exciting world of bulk emails (not spam). I actually learned a huge amount at my second job about SQL Server. It's also where I wrote my first web app (it was really just a web page that saved data to SQL Server, but I'm gonna count it). Those first two jobs really opened my eyes to the fact that I had no idea what I was doing and it was up to me to improve my skills.</li>
            <li>After a brief and unfortunate tenure with a small company that didn't end well I moved on to the wonderful world of software consulting. This is where it really, really hit me that I didn't know much about software and I needed to improve my skills significantly and dramatically. Fortunately, I was paired up with a great mentor and the company offered tuition reimbursement so I was able to get that Master's degree you can see down below in the Education section. Consulting was definitely a great experience, but I got a bit tired of feeling like a second-class citizen (you're on the team, but you aren't really a team member) so I moved on.</li>
            <li>I'm currently working with a great group of people to develop an application to allow organizations to manage their devices from the cloud. The last year has been a learning whirlwind (technologically as I got up to speed on Angular 2+ and also business-wise as I've learned about everything that goes in to securing devices on an enterprise level) and I'm excited to deliver the beta version in the next few months.</li>

          Education
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>In 2015 I earned a Master of Science in Engineering in Engineering Sciences with a Concentration in Software Engineering from Arizona State University (I love saying the full name of the degree). Although the program was challenging I felt like it really enhanced my understanding of the reasons for doing what I'd been doing for 10 years. It was nice to have the <b>why</b> to go with the what.<p>
          <p>I completed by Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems from DeVry University (yes, DeVry) in 2005. It was a good starting point for what has become a really fun career. In school I got to experience a little bit of everything (hardware, software, networking) and found that I really like solving problems through technology. Specifically, I like being able to change what computers do to make people happy. That education laid the groundwork for everything I've done professionally since.</p>
