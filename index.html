          About Me
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          I'm a talented software engineer with 11+ years of experience working on all aspects of code, from requirements gathering through deployment. I started out working with C# and hating JavaScript and now I work a lot with AngularJS (a JavaScript framework). Good times. I'm the author of the Angular Tree View module, which you can check out <a href="https://engineer-andrew.github.io/Angular-Tree-View/" target="_blank">here</a>

          Education
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          In 2015 I earned a Master of Science in Engineering in Engineering Sciences with a Concentration in Software Engineering from Arizona State University (I love saying the full name of the degree). Although the program was challenging I felt like it really enhanced my understanding of the reasons for doing what I'd been doing for 10 years.  It was nice to have the <b>why</b> to go with the what.
          <br />
          <br />
          I completed by Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems from DeVry University (yes, DeVry) in 2005. It was a good starting point for what has become a really fun career. In school I got to experience a little bit of everything (hardware, software, networking) and found that I really like solving problems through technology. Specifically, I like being able to change what computers do to make people happy. That education laid the groundwork for everything I've done professionally since.

          Experience
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          I started my career working for a small order fulfillment company where I got to work on cutting edge technology like dbase (in 2005). While I was there I built a full inventory management system using *drumroll* Microsoft Access! It was pretty impressive, but looking back on it is a bit embarrassing. On the other hand, it was a huge step-up from dbase and Visual FoxPro so I guess that's something.
          <br />
          <br />
          From there I moved to the exciting world of bulk emails (not spam). I actually learned a huge amount at my second job about SQL Server. It's also where I wrote my first web app (it was really just a web page that saved data to SQL Server, but I'm gonna count it). Those first two jobs really opened my eyes to the fact that I had no idea what I was doing and it was up to me to improve my skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          After a brief and unfortunate tenure with a small company that didn't end well I moved on to the wonderful world of software consulting. This is where it really, really hit me that I didn't know much about software and I needed to improve my skills significantly and dramatically. Fortunately, I was paired up with a great mentor and the company offered tuition reimbursement so I was able to get that Master's degree up there. Consulting was definitely a great experience, but I got a bit tired of feeling like a second-class citizen (you're on the team, but you aren't really a team member) so I moved on.
          <br />
          <br />
          Right now I'm very happy with what I'm doing and the team I get to work with everyday. I'm stoked to be working on a great greenfield application that will take a bunch of lessons learned and turn them into a fantastic product.
